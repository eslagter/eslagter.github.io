<p class="lead">
  The foundation is your connection to the soil and the house. It has be good.
</p>

The foundation makes sure you have a rigid, flat base to build your house on. We don't have earthquakes or tornados, so we don't have to think about securing the house into the soil that much.

## Tire pillar foundation
We plan to use a tire pillar foundation. This basically a pillar of car tires, filled tightly with soil and gravel.

Filling tires with earth, is a common practice in the Earth Ship community, where they create entire walls from filled tires.

You have to obtain tires of the same size, people say you can get them for free or for very little money from used tire dumps.

The tires are filled to the top, you really have to ram the mix into the tires, so the tire is completely full. This will give strength through compression.

Place rebar or threaded rod into the pillar, so we can later attach the wooden flooring to it.

## To investigate

* find where to obtain tires
* how many tires to stack
* how far apart can the pillars be placed
