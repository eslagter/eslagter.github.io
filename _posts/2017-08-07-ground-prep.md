<p class="lead">
  You have to start with a good foundation, in order to build a good house.
</p>

The soil has to be compact, loose sand will not work as a base.

Drainage is very important, you don't want standing water pushing up the soil when it freezes. We don't really have frost here in Spain, but things can change.

We plan to use a rubble trench underneath our foundation. This has multiple functions

* drain the soil underneath the foundation
* stabilize the soil
* provide a level ground

A disadvantage of this technique is that you can't put a full basement underneath the house. It is pretty common here in the region to have a water storage underneath the house, the Spanish word is 'aljibe'.

## Rubble trench

The rubble trench is created by digging a trench, 40 cm wide and at least 80 cm deep. Design the trench to have an exit point and slope the entire trench 3cm per meter! This has to be considered in the beginning.

You line the trench with a geotextile / used carpet to prevent sand and clay getting into the trench over time. This will extend the time that the drainage pipe stays clear.

You fill the trench first with course rocks, 2,5cm - 5cm big. Tamp it well. Lay the drainage pipe. Add more rocks until it is 20 - 30 cm under grade.

Buy washed stone, or wash them yourself!

Insulating the walls of the trench is an option, we will talk to our engineer if it is required in our climate. You can use wood fiber board as insulation.


## Conventional methods
Using the conventional concrete foundation, we could have a full basement, but we chose not to apply it, because the embodied energy of a concrete foundation is incredible. There are methods to reduce the embodied energy, by adding lime, or slag / ashes but that would require us to hire a specialist company doing most of the work.

## To figure out

* the frost line (if any)
* what geotextile or liner do we use?
* insulating walls or not
